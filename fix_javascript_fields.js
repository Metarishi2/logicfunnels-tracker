// Fix all JavaScript field references from followups_scheduled to followups_made
// This is a reference for manual updates needed

// Files that need to be updated:
// 1. src/components/AdminDashboard.js
// 2. src/components/RealTimeDashboard.js  
// 3. src/components/TestConnection.js

// Replace all instances of:
// - followups_scheduled -> followups_made
// - "Follow-ups Scheduled" -> "Follow-ups Made"

// AdminDashboard.js changes needed:
