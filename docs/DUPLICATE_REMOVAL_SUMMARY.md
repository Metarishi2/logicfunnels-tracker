# Duplicate Section Removal Summary (gigzs Activity Tracker)

## Changes Made
- All test and duplicate components, routes, and data have been removed from the codebase.
- Shared components are now used for real-time status, Looker Studio integration, and summary statistics.
- All dashboards (admin and user) use the same modern, professional UI components.

## Shared Components
- `src/components/shared/RealTimeStatus.js`: Real-time status indicator
- `src/components/shared/LookerStudioIntegration.js`: Looker Studio export section
- `src/components/shared/StatsGrid.js`: Summary statistics grid

## Benefits
- ✅ Reduced code duplication
- ✅ Easier maintenance
- ✅ Consistent UI across all dashboards
- ✅ Better organization and flexibility
